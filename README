Big Data Project

Instrucion to run the code:

1. Connect to NYU HPC

2. ssh dumbo

3. In /home/<user>/ directory, execute the following:
3.1 vi .bashrc
3.2 In the above created file .bashrc, enter the following lines:

alias hfs='/usr/bin/hadoop fs '
export HAS=/opt/cloudera/parcels/CDH-5.9.0-1.cdh5.9.0.p0.23/lib
export HSJ=hadoop-mapreduce/hadoop-streaming.jar
alias hjs='/usr/bin/hadoop jar $HAS/$HSJ'

4. Download the git repository either from the git web console by clicking on "Download ZIP" or by executing the following command:
git clone https://github.com/aparajita2930/NYC_Complaints_Analysis.git

5. cd NYC_Complaints_Analysis

6. From the top level directory structure, execute the run.sh script by the following command:
sh run.sh

This would generate all the summary files in the directory "out_data". This is to ensure that the output files generated by us in the directory "results/res_col_summary" during our runs are not overwritten.

7. From the top level directory structure, execute the run_use_cases.sh script using the following command to get the results of other analysis performed to obtain trends from the data:
sh run_use_cases.sh

This would generate all the output files in the directory "use_cases_data". This is to ensure that the output files generated by us in the directory "results/res_use_cases" is not overwritten.

8. To generate the plots: Please run the code to generate the plots on local machine and not on NYU HPC/DUMBO.
Requirements: 
The plot generation requires the packages: matplotlib, seaborn, jupyter and csv
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
pip install jupyter -- There are times when this does not work on Python 2, in that case, please install Anaconda following the instructions on: https://www.continuum.io/downloads

Then execute the following command:
cd results/plots
jupyter notebook results/plots/visualizations.ipynb

You can run all the cells in the notebook by clicking on the menu Cell -> Run All.

You can view all the plots in the notebook hosted at https://github.com/aparajita2930/NYC_Complaints_Analysis/blob/master/results/plots/visualizations.ipynb
